# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple Python-based number guessing game. It generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low, continuing until the correct number is guessed.

## 📌 Objective

To build a fun, interactive game that strengthens basic programming skills such as loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program randomly selects a number within a specified range.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. Feedback is provided:
   - If the guess is **too low**, the user is asked to guess again.
   - If the guess is **too high**, the user is asked to guess again.
4. Once the correct number is guessed, the program displays the total number of attempts.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module

## 📄 Features

- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Interactive command-line interface
- Tracks and displays number of attempts
